# Introduction
DotNetEventHandlers is a sample .NET class library that creates custom event handlers for the Task entity.  For this example, we create two event handlers:
1. Saving - verifies that the user added a note to the task.
2. Constructed - applies default values to new tasks.

## Running the solution
1. Clone the repo
2. Build the solution
3. Copy DotNetEventHandlers.dll to the bin folder of your web application
