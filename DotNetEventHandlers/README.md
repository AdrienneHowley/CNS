# DotNetEventHandlers
For those who prefer semicolons and curly brackets over the drag & drop visual experience provided by CampusNexus Workflow, DotNetEventHandlers is a sample .NET class library that introduces how to create event handlers in C#.  For this example, we create two event handlers against the Task entity:
1. Saving - verifies that the user added a note to the task.
2. Constructed - applies default values to new tasks.

To get started:
1. Clone the repository and open **DotNetEventHandlers.sln** in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution
3. Copy DontNetEventHandlers.dll to the \bin folder of your web application
